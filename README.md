### Workflow Ideas
Create a signup form simply requesting an `Admin Account Username` that your client created with an EXTREAMLY long password that nobody ever sees - and then provide this plugin as a downloadable when your service has been purchased - provide the derfault WP Plugin installation instructions above.
