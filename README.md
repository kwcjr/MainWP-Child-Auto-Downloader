## Installation

Installable just like a regular WP plugin from the WordPress UI or manually via SFTP.

**WordPress UI**

1. Activate the plugin by clicking the BLUE [ Activate Plugin ] button.

##### Workflow Ideas

Create a signup form simply requesting an **Admin Account Username** of which you have instructed your client to create with    
an **EXTREAMLY secure/long password** that nobody will ever see - and then provide this plugin as a *downloadable* when your service has been purchased along with the default WP Plugin installation instructions above.

You connect via MainWP Dashboard to the clients website using the provided **Admin Account Username** & the MainWP White Label Extension takes care of the rest of the branding on the MainWP Child Plugin.
